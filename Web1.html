            <h2>Scientific Research Experience</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Currently I am working independently on a dissertation and research on <em>Self-correcting LQR Algorithm based on Convex Optimization and Uncertainty Weighting</em>.</li>
                <li>Currently I am working in the Department of Design on a project of <em>YatSpark（Smart Permission and Access for Resourcesharing Kit)</em> which is a smart home system with multi-user management and permission sharing functions.</li>
                <li>In 2023, I won the second prize in the <em>Chinese Mathematics Competitions.</em></li>
                <li>In 2022, as a team leader, I worked with other team members to complete a paper and research on <em>Spatial Modeling of Terrestrial Water Storage in China based on the XGBoost Algorithm</em>.</li>
                <li>On my daily live, I designed a single threaded pipeline CPU, modulated different sounds simultaneously, and designed a good filter.</li>

            <h2>Interesting Achievement</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Invited by the prominent game company <em>Mihoyo</em> to participate in <em>Pioneer Program</em> on <em>Honkai:Star Rail</em> to help develop and test future versions of the game's untested content, I have recently test the 3.3 and 3.4 version of the character's skills and have a in-depth communication with game planners. (I will not provide any information about that due to a confidentiality agreement.)</li>
                <li>My innovative use of the AI Axis-Action-Arrangement in <em>Honkai:Star Rail</em> has been a great help to the development and testing of the game.</li>
                <li>Publishing my own chart in the non-commercial music game <em>Dynamite</em>, which was officially recognised and is now a stable content and loved by players.</li>
